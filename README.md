## Abstract
Life expectancy refers to the number of years a person can expect to live, which can be influenced by various factors such as health, living environment, social life, and more. This project aims to explore the relationship between these factors and life expectancy. As the first step, we conduct data understanding by analyzing patterns in the data and performing data preparation. Next, we apply a Bagging method using decision tree as base estimators. This approach help reduce variance, improve overall performance, and is robust to outliers. The model performs well both on the training and testing data; however, there is a potential risk of overfitting, as indicated by the very high R-squared value. To address this issue, we attempted to use a Robust Scaler, but it did not significantly improve the model's performance. Therefore, additional information is necessary to further enhance the model's accuracy.
